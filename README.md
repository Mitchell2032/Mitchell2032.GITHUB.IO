# Hello World!

My name is Mithell2032

This is actually really hard to do for no reason whatsoever, but it's pretty fun so it's whatever. 

I'm doing this for some free extra credit, and because I finished everything else.

Jonathan Waddell is actually a cool dude about 10% of the time, and there is a fair chance he'll see this so I'm putting it here so he gets upset. Can't wait to see his reaction.

After he saw the last paragraph, he shut down my computer, which is the typical type of reaction I'd expect from a rapper who can't solve problems with words. Next time, don't meme on the memer.
